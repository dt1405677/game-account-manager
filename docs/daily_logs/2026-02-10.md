## Overview
Optimized the Game Account Manager application by implementing cloud synchronization and dynamic data loading. These changes ensure data persistence across devices and simplify future content updates.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Firebase Cloud Sync Integration
Addressed data synchronization issues to prevent data loss and support multi-device usage.
- **Authentication**: Added Google Sign-In button (`☁️ Login`) in the sidebar.
- **Realtime Database**: Implemented logic to save and load user data (money, inventory, completed tasks) from Firebase.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Established a "Cloud First" policy where cloud data overwrites local data on login to ensure consistency.
- **Offline Support**: Maintained `localStorage` as a fallback for offline usage.
- **Configuration**: Created `firebase-config.js` to manage Firebase credentials and initialization.

### 2. Dynamic Data Loading ("Dã Tẩu" Tasks)
Refactored the task management system involved in "Dã Tẩu" missions to be data-driven rather than hardcoded.
- **External Data Files**: Moved task lists to `chiso.txt`, `tichluy.txt`, and `vatpham.txt`.
- **Loader Implementation**: Updated `app.js` to fetch these files at runtime.
- **Benefits**: Allows non-developers to update game tasks by simply editing text files without touching the code.
- **Documentation**: Created `README_DYNAMIC_LOADING.md` with instructions on how to manage these files and run the local server.

### 3. Documentation & Deployment
- **Tech Stack**: Updated `TECH_STACK.md` to include Firebase and the new module-based architecture.
- **Deployment**: Created a guide for deploying changes to GitHub Pages (`deployment_guide.md`).
- **Local Development**: Added `start_server.ps1` to easily launch a local Python web server for testing modules.

- `index.html` (Modified UI)
- `README_DYNAMIC_LOADING.md` (New)
- `chiso.txt`, `tichluy.txt`, `vatpham.txt` (New data files)
- `start_server.ps1` (New utility)
